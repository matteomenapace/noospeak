			<li><a name="q10"><b>What is NooSpeak?</b></a><br>
				NooSpeak is an innovative approach to Web search. Instead of squeezing your brain to find the right set of keywords, you can speak to your favourite search engine the way you normally speak (what scientists call “natural language”). If you are familiar with online chats (what scientists call “instant messaging software”) you know what we mean.
			</li>
			<p>
			<li><a name="q20"><b>How does it work?</b></a><br>
				Google works because it relies on the millions of individuals posting websites to determine which other sites offer content of value. NooSpeak simply re-organizes and presents Google Search results in a way that is closer to natural language. It uses “weak artificial intelligence” to process your inputs and a set of ranking algorithms to form sentences and chatclouds for you.
			</li>		
			<p>						
			<li><a name="q30"><b>What is a chatcloud?</b></a><br>
				A chatcloud is a weighted list of words across a body of content (which could be your own current conversation with NooSpeak, your last entry, all conversations, ...). A chatcloud can show the frequency of words usage, highlight relationships among words, and enable topic browsing.
The more relevant words are displayed with a larger font or stronger emphasis, and the more recent ones are displayed in a brighter color. Each term in a chatcloud is a link to the collection of items that have that term.
			</li>
			<p>
			<li><a name="q40"><b>How do NooSpeak’s chatclouds work?</b></a><br>
				We have great plans for our chatclouds, but so far you can’t see them working properly. The current chatclouds display a weighted list of all the words you and NooSpeak have used within the current conversation. In other words, what your conversation is about. Soon chatclouds will display all the words which have been used by all users in relation to your entries: this will allow you to discover new words and browse related topics. <a href="chatcloudsoon.png" target="_blank">See how it will look like</a>.	
			</li>
			<p>
			<li><a name="q50"><b>Why should I use NooSpeak?</b></a><br>
				By using a language you are naturally familiar with, NooSpeak can make your search experience more convenient and efficient. Besides, NooSpeak might answer in ways that you will find novel or intriguing, and lead you to discover new resources or learn new words.
			</li>
			<p>
			<li><a name="q60"><b>What can I talk with NooSpeak about?</b></a><br>
				Chatting with NooSpeak is like having a conversation with the Web, so you can talk about anything and you will always get something back. In most cases though, you know already what you want and NooSpeak will help you refine your search.
			</li>
			<p>
			<li><a name="q70"><b>When will you support other languages?</b></a><br>
				We’re not sure yet. English was chosen because it is a widely known language, and the most used online. Anyway, if you really can’t stand English, select the unfiltered mode (<a href="#q110">see answer 11 to learn more</a>) and you will be able to chat in other languages.
			</li>
			<p>
			<li><a name="q80"><b>Where can I write my comments about NooSpeak?</b></a><br>
				We love feedback. Indeed we are building a “wish list” page where you will be able to see, vote and post any new feature or comment about NooSpeak. In the meanwhile, write to <a href="mailto:i.am.dissatisfied@gmail.com">i.am.dissatisfied@gmail.com</a> or use <a href="../feedback/01.html" target="_blank">this</a> feedback form.			
			</li>
			<p>
			<li><a name="q90"><b>Is my information private?</b></a><br>
				Yes, your information is private. NooSpeak does not base its conversation on your personal searches, although it does use information about the relative popularity of common topics to generate its sentences. Details about your personal identity cannot be tracked by browsing your conversations with NooSpeak, unless you deliberately write them (which we advise you not to do). 
			</li>
			<p>
			<li><a name="q100"><b>Is this Google speaking?</b></a><br>
				No, this is the Web speaking. Google does not author the Web, it just organizes it. Therefore, Google does not accept any responsibility for the content found on the Web, as well as for the content of NooSpeak.
			</li>
			<p>
			<li><a name="q110"><b>How do filtering settings affect my conversations with NooSpeak?</b></a><br>
					NooSpeak uses “weak artificial intelligence” to filter Web pages in order to provide you with sentences that make sense in a human way.<br>
					You can choose from among three Filtering settings: 
        			<ul>
          				<li><b> Strict filtering</b> No Web content (eg: no links to external resources) is used to chat with you in this case, but just artificial intelligence. This mode can be useful to teach NooSpeak how you wish it to answer you (<a href="#q120">see answer 12 to learn more</a>).
						</li>
						<li><b> Moderate filtering</b> artificial intelligence is enhanced with Web content: NooSpeak’s replies are clickable here, and they will lead you to the discovery of the World Wide Web. This is your default setting, so you will receive moderate filtering unless you change it.
          				</li>
					</ul>
					And finally...
					<ul>
			          	<li><b>No Filtering</b> as you’ve probably figured out, turns off artificial intelligence filtering completely, and lets you explore the World Wild Web. 
						</li>
        			</ul>
				
			</li>
			<p>
			<li><a name="q120"><b>Can I teach NooSpeak how to chat with me?</b></a><br>
				Not yet, but it will be possible soon. In order to teach NooSpeak, you will be required to create an account, and then start customizing your personal chatting search engine. 
			</li>
			<p>
			<li><a name="q130"><b>What browsers do NooSpeak work at best with?</b></a><br>
				NooSpeak likes Firefox, an open-source browser that you can download for free from <a href="http://www.firefox.com">here</a>. NooSpeak does not like Microsoft Internet Explorer, nor it likes Apple Safari, but it will work there as well fairly soon.
