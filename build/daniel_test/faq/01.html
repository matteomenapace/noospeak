				<font size="-1"><a name="q1"><b>What is NooSpeak?</b></a><br>
					NooSpeak is a revolutionary approach to Web search. Instead of squeezing your brain to find a bunch of keywords, you can speak to Google the way you normally speak (what scientists call “natural language”). If you are familiar with online chats (what scientists call “instant messaging software”) you know what we mean.
<!--And there is more: as you type into the search box, Google guesses what you're typing and offers suggestions in real time.
And even more: you can also read what other people have talked about, and discover how popular the subjects of your conversation are.	-->
			  	</font>
			</li>
			<p>
			<li>
				<font size="-1"><a name="q2"><b>That's pretty cool. How does it do that?</b></a><br>
					Google's database has become pretty vast in the last few years, thanks to millions of people using Google’s services everyday. That’s Google’s <em>memory</em>. NooSpeak <em>brain</em> uses a wide range of algorithms to predict the answers users are most likely to want to see. <!--The more you speak with NooSpeak, the more it learns and the better it answers.-->
				</font>
			</li>		
			<p>						
			<li>
				<font size="-1"><a name="q3"><b>Google works well as is. Why should I use NooSpeak?</b></a><br>
					By using a language you are naturally familiar with, NooSpeak can make your online experience more convenient and efficient. NooSpeak might answer in ways that you will find novel or intriguing. We think that NooSpeak is just much easier and funnier than the good old Google Search.
				</font>
			</li>
			<p>
			<li>
				<font size="-1"><a name="q4"><b>How do I get back to normal Google?</b></a><br>
					You can go directly to <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>, or type http://www.google.com into your browser's address field; either way, you'll be back using ordinary Google search without NooSpeak.
				</font>	
			</li>
			<p>
			<li>
				<font size="-1"><a name="q5"><b>How about a few examples of when it works best?</b></a><br>
					NooSpeak can handle an average conversation quite well. You can follow the most popular topics, suggested in real time, or you can try and engage Google in a conversation about Wittgenstein’s games of language, if you dare.
				</font>
			</li>
			<p>
			<li>
				<font size="-1"><a name="q6"><b>When will you support other languages?</b></a><br>
					We're not sure yet. But we're always interested in expanding our products into more languages, and hope to be able to offer you such services soon! Anyway, if you select the <em>unfiltered mode</em> (see answer X to learn more) you will be able to chat in languages other than English.

					We love feedback. Please send your NooSpeak comments, criticisms and suggestions to us at  <a href="mailto:i.am.dissatisfied@gmail.com">i.am.dissatisfied@gmail.com</a> - We always read every email our users send us.

				<font size="-1"><a name="q8"><b>I don't want anyone to know I'm into lemur racing. Is my information private?</b></a><br>
					Yes, your information is private. NooSpeak does not base its conversation on your personal searches, although it does use information about the relative popularity of common topics to generate its sentences.
				</font>
			</li>

			<li>
				<font size="-1"><a name="q9"><b>Can NooSpeak see what I'm typing?</b></a><br>
					Just as E.T.(TM) needs to phone home in order to get a spaceship to pick him up, NooSpeak needs to talk to Google’s database while you type in order to keep the conversation going. Everything you type, though, is protected by Google's privacy policy. <!--NooSpeak does not base its conversation on your personal search history, unless you explicitly want to.--> 
				</font>
			</li>

				<font size="-1"><a name="q10"><b>How do filtering settings affect my conversations with NooSpeak?</b></a><br>
					NooSpeak uses Artificial Intelligence to filter Web pages in order to provide you with sentences that make sense in a human way.<br>
					You can choose from among three Filtering settings: 
        			<ul>
          				<li><b> Strict filtering</b> No Web content is used to chat with you in this case, but just Artificial Intelligence. Responses make always sense, but they become repetitive after a while.
						</li>
						<li><b> Moderate filtering</b> Artificial Intelligence is enhanced with Web content. This is your default setting; you&rsquo;ll receive moderate filtering unless you change it.
          				</li>
					</ul>
					And finally&hellip;
					<ul>
			          	<li><b>No Filtering</b> As you&rsquo;ve probably figured out, turns off Artificial Intelligence filtering completely. 
						</li>
        			</ul>
