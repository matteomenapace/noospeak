					Google Speaks is a revolutionary approach to Web search. Instead of squeezing your brain to find a bunch of keywords, you can speak to Google the way you normally speak (what scientists call “natural language”). If you are familiar with online chats (what scientists call “instant messaging software”) you know what we mean.
And there is more: as you type into the search box, Google guesses what you're typing and offers suggestions in real time.
And even more: you can also read what other people have talked about, and discover how popular the subjects of your conversation are.

				<font size="-1"><a name="q2"><b>That's pretty cool. How does it do that?</b></a><br>
					Our database has become pretty vast in the last few years, thanks to millions of people using Google’s services everyday. That’s Google’s “memory”. Its “brain” instead uses a wide range of algorithms to predict the answers users are most likely to want to see. The more you speak with Google, the more it learns and the better it answers.
					<p>
				
			</font></li>
			<li>
				<font size="-1"><a name="q3"><b>Google works well as is. Why should I use Google Speaks?</b></a><br>
					By using a language you are naturally familiar with, Google Speaks can make your online experience more convenient and efficient. Google Speaks might answer in ways that you will find novel or intriguing. We think that Google Speaks is just much easier and funnier than the good old Google.
					<p>

			<li>
				<font size="-1"><a name="q4"><b>How do I get back to normal Google?</b></a><br>
					You can go directly to http://www.google.com, or type http://www.google.com into your browser's address field; either way, you'll be back using ordinary Google search without Google Speaks.
					<p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<font size="-1"><a name="q5"><b>How about a few examples of when it works best?</b></a><br>
					Google Speaks can handle an average conversation quite well. You can follow the most popular topics, suggested in real time, or you can try and engage Google in a conversation about Wittgenstein’s games of language, if you dare.
					<p>
				
			</font></li>
			<li>
				<font size="-1"><a name="q6"><b>When will you support other languages?</b></a><br>
					We're not sure yet. But we're always interested in expanding our products into more languages, and hope to be able to offer you such services soon!

				<font size="-1"><a name="q7"><b>Here's my comment about Google Speaks. Ready to write this down?</b></a><br>
					We love feedback. Please send your Google Speaks comments, criticisms and suggestions to us at  <a href="mailto:i.am.dissatisfied@gmail.com">i.am.dissatisfied@gmail.com</a> -- we always read every email our users send us.
					<p>

				<font size="-1"><a name="q8"><b>I don't want anyone to know I'm into lemur racing. Is my information private?</b></a><br>
					Yes, your information is private. Google Speaks does not base its conversation on your personal searches, although it does use information about the relative popularity of common searches to generate its sentences.

				<font size="-1"><a name="q9"><b>Can Google Speaks see what I'm typing?</b></a><br>
					Just as E.T.(TM) needs to phone home in order to get a spaceship to pick him up, Google Speaks needs to talk to Google’s database while you type in order to keep the conversation going. Everything you type, though, is protected by Google's privacy policy. Google Speaks does not base its conversation on your personal search history, unless you explicitly want to.
