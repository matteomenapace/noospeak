<h3>WHAT IS THIS PROJECT ABOUT?</h3>
<form>
<p class="p1"><span>
This project is a 
<select name="type">
<option value=1>parody
<option value=2>spoof
<option value=3>manipulation
<option value=4>literary abuse
<option value=5>bastardisation
</select>  
of 
<select name="object">
<option value=1>a search engine
<option value=2>Google
<option value=3>Goooogle
</select> 
, in which some aspects of the typical searching experience 
( <input type=checkbox value="task-focused" name="aspects[]">task-focused,
<input type=checkbox value="keywords-based query" name="aspects[]">keywords-based query,
<input type=checkbox value="box-button-list structure" name="aspects[]">box-button-list structure,
<input type=checkbox value="several iterations" name="aspects[]">several iterations,
<input type=checkbox value="almost infinite list of results" name="aspects[]">almost infinite list of results
) are going to be 
<select name="actions">
<option value=1>subverted
<option value=2>decontextualised
<option value=3>deconstructed
</select> 
, in order to create a 
<select name="result">
<option value=1>model
<option value=2>simulation
<option value=3>appearance
</select> 
 of 
 <acronym title="a human written or spoken language as opposed to a computer language">natural language</acronym>
 <select name="interaction">
<option value=1>interaction
<option value=2>dialogue
<option value=3>conversation
<option value=4>exchange
</select>  
 between a user and the software agent.
 <br>
In other words: a 
<acronym title="a synchronous exchange of remarks, usually with other people, over a computer network">chat</acronym>
 with 
<select name="object2">
<option value=1>Google
<option value=2>a search engine
</select>
.
<br>
It questions the 
<select name="assumed">
<option value=1>assumed
<option value=2>believed
<option value=3>purported
</select>
neutrality of 
<select name="object3">
<option value=1>Google
<option value=2>a search engine
</select>
both in terms of 
<acronym title="the results of a search query">content</acronym> 
and of 
<acronym title="the way results are presented, and the searching mechanism">expression</acronym> 
. As searching is becoming the interface that an increasing number of people use to navigate in the 
<acronym title="a global interconnected text, text in its semiotic meaning: a system of communication">Web</acronym> 
 it is important to understand how 
<select name="object4">
<option value=1>a search engine
<option value=2>Google
<option value=3>you know what
</select>
 can drive 
 <select name="whose1">
<option value=1>their
<option value=2>our
</select>
clicks, but also how search shapes 
 <select name="whose2">
<option value=1>our
<option value=2>their
</select>
 behaviour and 
  <select name="whose3">
<option value=1>their
<option value=2>our
<option value=3>my
</select>
 language.
<br>
The 
<acronym title="large collections of writings of a specific kind or on a specific subject">corpora</acronym> 
 of human inputs and Google answers will create two profiles, which are growing and changing with the use of the
 <select name="typed">
<option value=1>parodied
<option value=2>manipulated
<option value=3>bastardised
<option value=4>spoofed
</select> 
 search engine:<br>
<input type=checkbox value="average" name="profiles[]"> the average 
<acronym title="human">user</acronym>
<br>
<input type=checkbox value="mediated" name="profiles[]"> the average 
<acronym title="human through Google">mediated user</acronym>: as Google picks up the most popular results in his index to answer, they should reflect the average Web user.
<br><br>
<b>IN SHORT: forget about command prompt keywords search. Write to Google as if it were your friend, see what it answers. Begin a chat. See what other people chatted about.</b>
<br>
<h3>WHAT IS THE POINT?</h3>
There are many points:
<br>
<input type=checkbox value=1 name="points[]"> an unconventional search mechanism, closer to human-human interaction, though delivered in a slightly familiar way makes you think about standardised behaviours, questioning your personal habits
<br>
<input type=checkbox value=2 name="points[]"> the limited and arbitrary list of results provided by Google makes you reflect upon the influence a search engine has on your personal choices (thinking about the overload of information we face in our workaday tasks would be a positive side effect)
<br>
<input type=checkbox value=3 name="points[]"> comparing the two 
<acronym title="average user and average mediated user">profiles</acronym> makes you think about the neutrality of Google, its power in influencing millions of people habits and choices.
